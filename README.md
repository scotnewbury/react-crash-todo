# TodoList

This is the todo list web applications that was built as part of the React Crash Course.

A minor modification from the course was done to the final project code. There is an issue writing back to the REST API at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos, it always uses the same id number, 201.

I shifted the code back to writing to the local state so that the functionality was restored.
